 * compared and then recorded the new state as the baseline, and three callers ran
 * it: the daily alarm, the extensions screen, and the area counter on the
 * overview. The counter and the screen share one handler, so the first of them
 * consumed the difference — measured 2026-08-20, the counter said there were
 * changes and the screen, opened immediately after, said there were none.
 *
 * The fixture carries **non-empty host permissions**, which the old one did not:
 * both sides of every comparison were `hostPermissions: []`, so the defect that
 * reported every extension as having just widened its access, `critical`, on
 * every run, could not be seen from here.
