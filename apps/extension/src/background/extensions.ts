/**
 * Keeping track of what the other extensions are allowed to do.
 *
 * **Reading never writes. Only a decision writes.** That sentence is the whole
 * design and it replaces a single function that did both, which broke three ways
 * at once (measured 2026-08-20).
 *
 * The old `reviewInventory` compared, then recorded the new state as the
 * baseline, and it was called from three places: the daily alarm, the extensions
 * screen, and the area counter on the overview. The counter and the screen run
 * off the same handler, so **the first of them consumed the difference** — the
 * counter said "3 changes" and the screen, opened half a second later, said
 * nothing had changed. It also journalled on every screen open, so one permission
 * change became as many journal rows as the user had visits.
 *
 * A change is now an unacknowledged fact, exactly like a finding: it keeps being
 * reported until the user accepts it, and accepting is the one operation that
 * moves the baseline. Which also fixes what "Trust" did, or rather did not: it
 * wrote an `exceptions` row with `scope: 'extension'` that **nothing in the
 * repository ever read**, so the change came back on the next screen open and the
 * button was decoration.
