 * The banner for a download the background judged.
 *
 * The judging happens in the worker, because that is where the browser reports
 * a download starting and where it can still be cancelled. The telling has to
 * happen here, because a worker has nowhere to say anything — and for a while
 * it did not happen at all: the worker announced its verdict to a message type
 * nobody listened for, so a blocked file was journalled and the person who
 * started it saw nothing.
 *
 * A blocked download has already been cancelled by the time this runs. The
 * banner says so rather than offering to stop it, and the way back is to fetch
 * the file again deliberately — an offer this surface does not make, because
 * re-downloading something the feeds named is a decision that belongs on the
 * page the user came from, not in a banner.
