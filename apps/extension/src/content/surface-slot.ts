/**
 * One in-page warning panel at a time, and one place that decides which.
 *
 * **Why a slot rather than a variable per module.** Six modules mount banners —
 * injection and password from the content entry, plus `credential.ts`, `traps.ts`,
 * `download.ts` and `lookalike.ts` — and each kept its own `banner` handle. On a
 * fixture that was both a lookalike and poisoned, two of them mounted: same
 * `position: fixed`, same `inset-block-end`/`inset-inline-end`, so one panel was drawn
 * exactly on top of the other and the lower one could not be read at all. Found by a
 * test asking for one banner and getting two (B-69).
 *
 * SCN-031 had already written the rule down for the frame case — "a finding inside a
 * frame stays in the journal rather than becoming a second overlay, because two
 * warnings on one page is how a warning stops being read". That rule is about the
 * **surface**, not about the source, and it had been applied to one source out of
 * three.
 *
 * **The rule, and why replacement is by severity.** The panel holds the worst thing
 * known about the page. A worse finding takes the slot, because a person looking at
 * "this site resembles another" should not keep reading that while something
 * `critical` is also true. A finding that is not worse does not get drawn — it gets a
 * line in the panel that is already up, so the fact is on screen without a second
 * overlay, and it remains in the popup and the journal like every other finding.
 *
 * **The slot also owns the watch.** `keepSurfaceMounted` was wired into two of the six
 * mount sites when it was written, which is exactly the shape this file exists to
 * remove: a rule about the surface, applied per source.
