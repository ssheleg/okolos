 * `exportAll` decides what is withheld — that is a promise about the data, and it lives
 * with the data. Until 2026-08-20 it also wrote the sentences explaining the decision,
 * in English, from a package whose dependencies are `@okolos/contracts` and `idb`
 * (B-75). The decision stayed; the words came here, where the catalogue is.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a const in the page, for the reason `gate-words.ts` is one:
 * `options/index.ts` builds the whole settings surface at import, so nothing in it can
 * be called from a test — and the note explaining what a file withholds is the last
 * thing that should be checked only by reading it.
 *
 * Resolved at write time, unlike a journal row. The file is a snapshot the user keeps
 * and re-reads in a text editor, not through this product: there is no later moment at
 * which anything could resolve a key, so the language is the one in force when they
 * asked for the file.
