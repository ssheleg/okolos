<!-- Managed with super-ux (ux-contract v4). The HOW layer: task analysis and user flows scenarios trace to. -->

# Flows — HOW layer

Screens are referenced by `SCR-ID`; their full specs live once in
[screens.md](screens.md). Rules obeyed here: every entry point listed, error
nodes end in a labelled recovery edge, happy paths stay at five steps or
fewer.

Scope: P0–P5 (see [../product-vision.md](../product-vision.md) §6). Flows for
the proactive layer, sync and carer mode arrive with their milestones.

## Flows

### FLW-01: First run — instant check
- **Traces:** ST-018, ST-001, ST-013 (JTBD-02, JTBD-04, JRN-01/#4)
- **Goal:** within 30 seconds of install the user sees real findings from their own browser, with no account and no configuration
- **Entry points:** extension installed (`onInstalled`); "run check again" from SCR-07
- **Success exit:** findings queue populated, or an explicit clean result
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Understand what this thing does and what it just checked
  2. See findings from their own tabs and extensions
  3. Decide what to do first
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: First-run check] -->|auto-start on install| B{Local checks run}
  B -->|scanning| A_load[State: loading with per-check progress]
  A_load --> C{Findings?}
  C -->|yes| D[Screen: Findings queue - top 3 actions]
  C -->|no| E[Screen: First-run check - clean result]
  B -->|a check could not run| B_err[Inline: check unavailable + reason]
  B_err -->|retry or skip| C
  D -->|open a finding| F[Screen: Finding inspector or Leaks or Extensions]
  E -->|continue| G[Screen: Popup available in toolbar]
```

  | SCR-07 Findings queue | success, empty |

### FLW-02: Hidden instruction found on a page
- **Traces:** ST-001, ST-002, ST-003 (JTBD-01, JRN-01/#5)
- **Goal:** the user learns a page carried instructions for an AI, can inspect them, and the page is left safe for their assistant
- **Entry points:** page load; DOM mutation batch; manual "re-scan" from SCR-02
- **Success exit:** finding neutralised and journalled, or dismissed deliberately
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Notice the banner without losing the page
  2. Inspect what was hidden and how
  3. Keep it neutralised, or restore and continue
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Page] -->|stage 1-2 fire| B[Screen: In-page banner - injection variant]
  B -->|auto for high confidence| N[Nodes neutralised, reversible]
  B -->|show me| C[Screen: Finding inspector]

### FLW-03: Agent about to act on a compromised page
- **Traces:** ST-004 (JTBD-01, JRN-01/#6)
- **Goal:** no sensitive action proceeds from a page with an unresolved injection without an explicit human decision
- **Entry points:** sensitive action detected on a page carrying an unresolved finding
- **Success exit:** the user allowed or blocked the action knowingly
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See that this page is compromised and what the action is
  2. Decide once, explicitly
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Page with unresolved finding] -->|sensitive action attempted| B[Screen: Agent action gate]
  B -->|allow once| C[Action proceeds, journalled]
  B -->|block| D[Action cancelled, journalled]

### FLW-04: Known-malicious page blocked
- **Traces:** ST-005, ST-016 (JTBD-02, JRN-03/#2)
- **Goal:** the page never renders; the user understands why and has an honest way past
- **Entry points:** navigation to a URL matching a signed feed entry
- **Success exit:** user leaves safely, or proceeds deliberately with the choice remembered
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Understand what was blocked and on whose authority
  2. Leave, or override deliberately
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Navigation started] --> B{Feed match?}
  B -->|yes| C[Screen: Block interstitial]
  B -->|no| Z[Page loads normally]
  C -->|go back| D[Previous page]
  C -->|continue anyway| E[Page loads; domain exception saved + journalled]

  | SCR-05 Block interstitial | success, error |
  | SCR-14 Public domain status | success |

### FLW-05: Lookalike domain warning
- **Traces:** ST-006 (JTBD-02)
- **Goal:** the user sees that the domain resembles one they trust but is not it, before interacting
- **Entry points:** page load on a domain within confusable/typo distance of the watchlist or the popular-domains list
- **Success exit:** the user leaves, or marks the domain legitimate and it stops warning
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See both spellings side by side
  2. Decide: leave, or mark as legitimate
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Page] -->|confusable/typo match| B[Screen: In-page banner - lookalike variant]
  B -->|show comparison| C[State: visited vs expected domain, decoded punycode]
  C -->|leave| D[Back to previous page]

### FLW-06: ClickFix — page copies a command
- **Traces:** ST-007 (JTBD-02, JRN-03/#3)
- **Goal:** interrupt between the clipboard write and the user pasting into a system dialog — the last moment we can reach
- **Entry points:** script-initiated clipboard write containing a shell-like payload, with no genuine user copy action
- **Success exit:** user does not run the command; clipboard content is flagged
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Stop before switching windows
  2. Understand in one sentence why this is fake
  3. Leave, or override deliberately
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Page - fake CAPTCHA] -->|script writes command to clipboard| B[Screen: In-page banner - clickfix variant, blocking]
  B -->|what is this| C[State: plain-language explanation + the copied text shown verbatim]

### FLW-07: Browser-lock trap escape
- **Traces:** ST-008 (JTBD-02, JTBD-06)
- **Goal:** break the trap and explain it, so the user does not call the number on screen
- **Entry points:** forced fullscreen without user gesture; looping modal dialogs; fake OS/browser chrome
- **Success exit:** the user is out of the trap and on a safe page
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Regain control of the window
  2. Understand it was fake
  3. Leave
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Page - fake lock] -->|forced fullscreen or dialog loop| B[Trap broken: fullscreen exited, dialogs suppressed]

- **Traces:** ST-009 (JTBD-02)
- **Goal:** a dangerous file is stopped before it is saved, and the user is told exactly which checks applied
- **Entry points:** download started
- **Success exit:** file kept after a clean check, or discarded after a warning
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See the verdict before the file lands
  2. Keep or discard
- **Flow:**

```mermaid

### FLW-09: Credential-entry guard
- **Traces:** ST-010 (JTBD-02, JRN-03/#4)
- **Goal:** the user pauses before typing a password or card into a domain that is new or unlike the brand it imitates
- **Entry points:** focus on a password or payment field on an untrusted domain
- **Success exit:** the user leaves, or proceeds having trusted the domain
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See why this domain is unusual, before typing
  2. Leave or trust
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Page with password or card field] -->|field focused, domain untrusted| B[Screen: In-page banner - credential variant, inline near field]

- **Goal:** the user learns a password is compromised without the password leaving the device
- **Entry points:** password submitted on a form; manual check in SCR-08
- **Success exit:** verdict shown; if compromised, the repair step is one click away
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Learn the verdict at the moment it matters
  2. See what actually left the device
  3. Start the repair
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Password submitted or entered manually] --> B[SHA-1 computed in page context]

### FLW-12: Extension change alert
- **Traces:** ST-013, ST-014 (JTBD-03)
- **Goal:** the user is told the moment an installed extension changes owner or gains permissions, and can act in one step
- **Entry points:** extension update detected; scheduled inventory snapshot; manual open of SCR-09
- **Success exit:** the delta is disabled, trusted, or acknowledged — never left silently pending

- **Goal:** the user can answer "what did this send?" from the UI, and check it against a real network trace
- **Entry points:** SCR-02 popup footer; SCR-12 settings; any finding's "what was sent" link
- **Success exit:** the user has seen, filtered, and optionally exported the outbound log
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See every outbound request with purpose and payload shape

### FLW-16: Recovery — "I already fell for it"
- **Traces:** ST-015 (JTBD-06, JRN-03/#5)
- **Goal:** turn panic into an ordered checklist matched to what actually happened
- **Entry points:** "I already ran it / already entered it" from any banner; SCR-02 popup; SCR-07 queue
- **Success exit:** the checklist for that incident type is completed or explicitly deferred
- **Task analysis:**
  1. Say what happened
  2. Work an ordered list, most damaging first
  3. Mark the incident handled
- **Flow:**

### FLW-17: Daily check-in — popup, overview, and what changed
- **Traces:** ST-015, ST-017 (JTBD-02, JTBD-05, JRN-02/#6)
- **Goal:** the returning user sees the state of the current page and what needs
  them across every area, without a wall of old alerts and without scrolling to
  find out
- **Entry points:** toolbar icon (popup); badge on a new finding; the
  extension's own page opened directly (lands on the overview); **a deep link
  from the popup or from a banner, which opens its area directly** —
  `options.html#queue`, `#journal`, `#leaks`, `#extensions`, `#trusted`,
  `#audit`, `#data`, `#recovery=<kind>`
- **Success exit:** the user knows the current page's verdict, and has either
  acted on the top item or seen that nothing needs them — with the count of what
  does still visible on the way back
- **Task analysis:**
  1. See this page's verdict and today's count (popup)
  2. Either act on the top item in place, or open the area that owns it
  3. Coming to the page with no destination in mind: see what needs attention
     across all areas, ranked, and pick one
  4. Act there, then return — the return says how much is left
- **Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Screen: Popup] -->|current page verdict| B{Anything new?}
  B -->|no| C[State: nothing new since last check + last-checked time]
  B -->|yes| D[Screen: Journal and weekly diff - only changes]

- **What changed here, 2026-08-12.** The diagram above already drew the journal,
  the queue and the self-audit as separate screens with transitions between
  them; the implementation stacked all eight areas on one page and made the
  transitions scroll positions — of which exactly one was wired
  (`SECTION_FOR_HASH` held `#queue`, while the popup produced `#journal` from
  two call sites). So the deep-link edges and the overview node are not a new
  design; they are this flow, finally built. The redesign, its findings and the
  losing alternative are in
  [plans/2026-08-12-options-dashboard.md](plans/2026-08-12-options-dashboard.md).
