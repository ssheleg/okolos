/**
 * REQ-09 — the traversal budget, measured where it matters.
 *
 * A synthetic DOM has no layout engine, so a bench under happy-dom would
 * measure the algorithm and quietly ignore the expensive part: resolving
 * computed styles. These assertions read a performance measure taken inside a
 * real Chromium on a real page.
 *
 * **The mount wait is a precondition here too, and it cannot relax what is measured.**
 * This paragraph used to claim the opposite — that the waits stayed local because a
 * generous imported budget would loosen the ceiling — while the three waits five lines
 * below it imported exactly that number. What actually protects the measurement is that
 * every figure asserted comes from the product's own `performance.measure`, not from the
 * test's stopwatch, plus the assertion that a *missing* measure is a failure rather than a
 * value under the ceiling. Corrected 2026-08-21, when the waits moved to `expectSurface`
 * for its report.

   *
   * This used to be `duration < 60`, and on 2026-08-21 it failed on CI at **60.6 ms** — not
   * because the product got slower but because the collector's own wall-clock ceiling had
   * just been removed as a *decision* (B-110: eight milliseconds decided how much of a page
   * got read, so on a busy machine the scan gave up on a seven-node page and the page went
   * unwarned). With that gone, a truncated walk runs to its **node** ceiling, and how long
   * that takes is a fact about the runner.
   *
   * Raising the number until green is the answer this project refuses. So the assertion
   * moved to what is deterministic: the walk **was** cut short, which the product says out
   * loud on the warning itself, and the duration is checked only against the hang guard it
   * is now the ceiling for. A page this size is truncated by nodes on every machine.

   * property that stops a hostile page reading it and equally stops this spec. Measured, not

   * first pass can happen against a document that is still arriving; the pass that hits the
   * ceiling is then the rescan. Reading the counter once caught that gap on a slower machine
   * and went red on CI (2026-08-21).
   *
   * The version after it was worse: `expect.poll(…).toMatchObject({ partial: expect.any(Number) })`
   * is true on the first tick, so it waited for nothing and the assertion after it still read
   * once. A check that cannot fail for the reason it was written is the decoy this session has
