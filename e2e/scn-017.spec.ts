 * the inventory, and reports a real state. The delta logic itself is covered
 * against fixtures in core-extensions.
 *
 * Every assertion is unconditional on purpose. The first version of this file
 * branched on the state and returned early when it was not `ready` — which
 * meant that losing the `management` permission, the exact regression this
 * screen exists to survive, would have turned the test green by skipping it.
