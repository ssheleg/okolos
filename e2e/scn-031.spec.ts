/**
 * A finding inside an embedded frame is told to the page that embeds it.
 *
 * The content script runs in every frame because injections hide in iframes too,
 * and only the top frame shows a warning — a banner mounted inside a subframe can
 * be invisible, clipped, or drawn a dozen times across ad frames. Its own comment
 * said "subframes still collect and report; the top frame is the one that speaks",
 * and the reporting half did not exist: the frame neutralised the injection, armed
 * the agent gate, and returned. A poisoned iframe was handled and never mentioned.
 *
 * Two origins, because a same-origin frame is not the case that matters and would
 * not get its own frame id. The parent is deliberately clean: a page with its own
 * finding would raise a banner for its own reason and prove nothing about the relay.
 *
 * The banner renders into a closed shadow root, so presence and absence of the host
 * element are what this can honestly assert; the wording is covered by unit tests in
 * `packages/ui` and the catalogue by `tools/locales.test.ts`.
