/**
 * A login form inside an embedded frame is checked, and its finding reaches the page a
 * person is actually looking at.
 *
 * For two releases nothing watched it. `watchCredentialFields` stood under
 * `if (isTopFrame)`, and the comment above it claimed a subframe's form "is warned about
 * by the frame it is in" — which that condition prevented: the content script runs in
 * every frame, and in a subframe `isTopFrame` is false, so the block was skipped there
 * too. An OAuth or payment form in an iframe, which is the ordinary shape rather than
 * the exotic one, was watched by nobody (B-79).
 *
 * The half of the restriction that was right is kept: a frame does not draw. A banner
 * inside a 300×200 frame is clipped, and inside a hidden ad frame it warns nobody. So the
 * frame reports and the top frame draws — the same arrangement SCN-031 proved for
 * injections, over a relay that now carries a kind so the facts survive the trip.
 *
 * `g00gle.com` serves the form on purpose: it is the lookalike fixture, so the guard has
 * a real fact to state rather than only "we do not know". The parent is deliberately
 * clean and is not a lookalike, so nothing else on this page can raise a banner — a
 * warning that appears here came through the relay or not at all.
