/**
 * A password submitted from a form inside an embedded frame is checked, and the verdict
 * reaches the page a person is looking at — with a button that does what it says.
 *
 * Two defects met here, and both were invisible in the same way. The check stood under
 * `if (isTopFrame)`, so a password sent from an iframe was never compared against a
 * breach and never counted towards reuse (B-80) — the ordinary shape of a login, not the
 * exotic one. And the banner it would have drawn had four handlers that all returned
 * `undefined`, so "Сменить пароль" was a label with nothing behind it: a content script
 * cannot open a tab, `chrome.tabs` is not in its API surface, and the failure was silent
 * because nothing ever asked.
 *
 * `password` is submitted on purpose: its digest is in the shipped common list
 * (`background/password.ts:COMMON_SHA1`), so the verdict is `compromised` with no network
 * request at all — the answer this suite can rely on.
 *
 * The frame's host is not a lookalike, so the only reason a banner can name it is the
 * verdict. The pause before the password fires first and claims the panel at `minor`;
 * the leak verdict is `major` and takes it, which is the slot rule doing its job and is
 * asserted rather than waited out.

/**
 * The form does not navigate, and that is a statement about what this spec can prove.
 *
 * A form with an `action` navigates the frame on submit, and the navigation tears down the
 * frame's content script while `password/check` is still in flight — so the verdict is
 * lost whenever the navigation wins the race. Measured here: the spec passed alone and
 * failed twice inside the full suite, once with no banner at all. That race is real, it
 * predates this change, it affects the page's own form exactly the same way, and it is
 * filed as B-82 — it is not something a fixture should hide **or** be flaky about.
 *
 * `preventDefault` is also the common modern shape: a login form that posts with `fetch`
 * and stays on the page. The product's listener is capture-phase on `document`, so it sees
 * the submit before the page's own handler either way.
