/**
 * A password submitted by a form that **navigates**, and a verdict that survives the
 * navigation it caused.
 *
 * The check runs on submit and after it — deliberately, because interrupting a login
 * somebody was going to finish is worse than saying it afterwards. But a form with an
 * `action` takes the document with it, and the content script waiting for the answer goes
 * with the document: the verdict arrived at nobody, nothing was shown, and nothing was
 * recorded (B-82). It was found from the frame side, where a small frame navigates faster
 * than a full page, so it lost the race more often — `e2e/scn-035.spec.ts` passed alone
 * and failed inside the full suite until its fixture stopped navigating. This is that
 * fixture, kept.
 *
 * The verdict is now held for the tab and pushed to the next document there, which is the
 * more useful place anyway: after a login a person is on the site's own page, and "the
 * password you just sent to this site is in a breach" is as true there as on the form.
 *
 * `password` is submitted on purpose — its digest is in the shipped common list, so the
 * verdict costs no network request.
