/**
 * The block page refuses to be somebody else's iframe.
 *
 * `interstitial.html` is the one file this extension makes web-accessible, because the
 * blocker redirects a tab to it — and web-accessible means any page can embed it. A framed
 * copy would be the product's own block page, with its own "continue anyway" control,
 * inside a document an attacker lays out. What that buys is narrow and real: the control
 * records an exception for the last blocked address, so a click stolen by an overlay turns
 * off a block the product had made.
 *
 * The page cannot be made to *name* an arbitrary site — it asks the background rather than
 * reading its own query string, which is a decision that predates this spec. A click is
 * enough on its own.
 *
 * **Since 2026-08-21 there are two defences, and this spec asserts the outer one.**
 * `use_dynamic_url` on the resource means it answers only to a per-session address a page
 * cannot learn, so the embed never loads. The inner defence — the page refusing to draw
 * when it is not the top document — is asserted in `framed.test.ts`, and it is what would
 * still hold if the manifest were ever changed back.
