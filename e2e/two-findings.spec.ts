/**
 * A page that is both a lookalike and poisoned gets one panel, not two.
 *
 * The fixture that found this: `g00gle.com` serving hidden injected text. Two
 * detectors, two `mountBanner` calls, both `position: fixed` at the same
 * `inset-block-end`/`inset-inline-end` — so one warning was drawn exactly on top of
 * the other and the lower one could not be read at all (B-69). A test asking for one
 * banner and getting two is how it surfaced.
 *
 * SCN-031 had already recorded the rule for the frame case: two warnings on one page
 * is how a warning stops being read. It was applied to one source out of three,
 * because it lived in a comment about frames rather than in a place every source has
 * to pass through.
