 * checks that actually ran. A file behind authentication cannot be hashed; a
 * stale feed cannot vouch for a URL. Both are ordinary, and both produce the
 * same dishonest output if the missing check is silently treated as a pass —
 * a green tick the product did not earn, on the one screen where the user is
 * deciding whether to run something.
 *
 * So every check reports one of three things: it passed, it failed, or it did
 * not run and here is why. The verdict is assembled from those, and the "did
 * not run" list is part of what the user is shown rather than a footnote.
