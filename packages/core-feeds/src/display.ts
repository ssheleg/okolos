/**
 * What a list is called, as opposed to what it is keyed by.
 *
 * `phishing` is an identifier: it names a row in a table, a file at
 * `/feeds/phishing.json`, and a value in a signed update. It is not a name, and
 * the brand pack forbids showing one in place of the other — "владелец сайта не
 * должен читать `phishing` вместо названия списка". Until this module existed
 * he did, on the public status page and on every blocked page.
 *
 * Two consumers, one table:
 *
 *   - the **extension**, which is localised and asks the catalogue via `key`;
 *   - the **worker**, which serves one English page, has no catalogue, and
 *     reads `en` directly.
 *
 * `tools/feed-names.test.ts` asserts the two never disagree — the English here
 * must equal the English in the shipped catalogue — and that the worker
 * publishes exactly the identifiers listed below.
 *
 * **Third-party lists are not in this table on purpose.** OpenPhish, PhishTank,
 * URLhaus and Hudson Rock already call themselves by a human name, and the
 * terminology says those names are not translated. They pass through unchanged;
 * inventing a display name for someone else's list would be renaming it.
