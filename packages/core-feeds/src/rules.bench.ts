/**
 * How long it takes to turn a feed into blocking rules.
 *
 * REQ-09 named "rules ≤5 ms" as an acceptance criterion and nothing measured it: there
 * were no benchmark files at all, and `pnpm bench` exited 1 (B-49). This is the path the
 * number was about — it runs on every accepted feed update and on every change to the
 * exception list, which is every time a person marks a site legitimate.
 *
 * It reports rather than gates, for the reason `stage1.bench.ts` gives: a wall-clock
 * ceiling in CI is a flake, and this project keeps those out of the gate chain
 * deliberately.
