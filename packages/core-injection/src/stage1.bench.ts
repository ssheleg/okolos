/**
 * How long the first stage takes on a page the size of a real one.
 *
 * `pnpm bench` exited 1 from an empty run for weeks — a command that always fails is a
 * command people learn to skip, and four requirements named a benchmark as their
 * acceptance criterion while none existed (B-49).
 *
 * **These report; they do not gate.** A wall-clock ceiling in CI is the flake this
 * project refuses everywhere else — the same reasoning that keeps `suffix:gap` and
 * `graph:check` out of the gate chain. What holds the budget a *person* experiences is
 * `e2e/budget.spec.ts`, measured in a browser on a real page. What this answers is the
 * question that check cannot: which of the hot paths got slower, and by how much,
 * between two commits on one machine.
