/**
 * Stage 3 — the classifier, and the conditions under which it is allowed to
 * run at all.
 *
 * The interesting part of this stage is not the model. It is the gate. Running
 * inference on every page would cost a quarter of a second of someone's
 * browsing for nothing, and running it on text a deterministic rule already
 * decided would pay that price to learn what is already known. So it runs in
 * exactly one situation: hidden text exists (stage 1 fired) and no rule matched
 * it (stage 2 was silent). That is the only place a model can tell us something
 * the earlier stages cannot.
 *
 * Its verdicts are capped at `inform` by the ladder, not by this file. A score
 * cannot be checked by the person it affects, so it may raise suspicion and
 * never act.
