 * a verdict.
 *

 * ends in one of these, and all three named squats do.
 *
 * **What it still misses, deliberately:** a brand under a word gTLD that is not about
 * accounts — `paypal.shop`, `sberbank.city` — is not reported, because a real company
 * may well own that and the false positive costs more than the miss. The list is a
