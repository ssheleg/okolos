/**
 * Hosts that are the real thing, measured against the shipped watchlist.
 *
 * The module's own docstring says what it must never do: "flag the real thing …
 * a warning on `accounts.google.com` would teach the user to dismiss the next
 * one without reading it." Measured 2026-08-20, it flagged **twenty-one of these
 * thirty-four** — including every Russian government site, because `pfr.gov.ru`
 * and `nalog.gov.ru` share the label `gov` once you take the second-to-last one
 * as the registrant's; three of the largest mail providers, because `mail.ru`
 * put the word `mail` on the watchlist; and nine companies visited on their own
 * country domain.
 *
 * There was no test like this file. Every case in `check.test.ts` was written
 * from the attack outward, and the innocent population was represented by four
 * hosts. A detector's false-positive rate is a claim about the population it
 * will actually meet, and this is the closest thing to that population the
 * repository can hold offline.
