/**
 * The names worth impersonating.
 *
 * Shipped with the extension rather than fetched, because a lookalike check
 * that needs the network is a lookalike check that does not run on the page
 * where it matters. It is deliberately short: every entry costs a comparison on
 * every navigation, and a list of ten thousand brands would both slow the page
 * down and start flagging genuine sites that happen to be one letter apart.
 *
 * These are the targets that appear in phishing corpora year after year. A
 * user's own frequently-visited sites are added on top at runtime; that list is
 * theirs and never leaves the device.
 *
 * **The list is a coverage claim, and it has a market.** Until 2026-08-08 all
 * 29 entries were Western — no bank, no state services portal, no marketplace
 * from the market this product is built for — while the product's own published
 * feed listed `sberbank-online-vhod.test` and `gosuslugi-podtverzhdenie.test`.
 * A lookalike check protects the names it knows; that one protected PayPal and
 * DHL for an audience being phished for Sberbank.
