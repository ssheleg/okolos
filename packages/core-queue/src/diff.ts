/**
 * What changed since the last time you looked.
 *
 * The default view of a security product's history is the thing that ruins it:
 * an ever-growing red list where last month's handled item sits next to this
 * morning's. So the journal answers a narrower question — what is new since
 * your last check — and full history is something you ask for.
 *
 * Pure, and clock-free: the caller supplies the moment of the last check. That
 * is what makes the same journal produce the same diff wherever it runs.
