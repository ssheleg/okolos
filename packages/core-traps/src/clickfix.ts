/**
 * ClickFix: the page copies a command, and asks the user to run it.
 *
 * The attack does not exploit the browser at all. It persuades a person to
 * paste a line into a box outside it — Win+R, a terminal, PowerShell — where no
 * browser protection reaches. The host is usually a legitimate site that has
 * been compromised, so nothing about the domain gives it away.
 *
 * Three signals, and the third one is load-bearing in a way the first draft of
 * this file missed. "Copy this, paste it in your terminal, press Enter" with a
 * scripted copy behind it describes a ClickFix page — and it equally describes
 * every installation page on every developer site in the world, which is where
 * the copy button that fires `execCommand('copy')` actually lives.
 *
 * What separates them is the pretext. Real documentation asks you to run a
 * command because you asked how to install something. A ClickFix page asks you
 * to run one to prove you are human, or to fix an error it invented. No
 * genuine verification has ever required a terminal, so that claim is the
 * signal that cannot be innocent, and nothing here fires without it.

 * it — they are long enough that a substring hit is not a false positive on
 * its own, and the verdict needs the pretext as well. And `\w` is
