 * entry written before the request and a failed write cancelling it, a closed set
 * of six purposes, a redactor with two rounds of percent-decoding — and the
 * destination was computed **only for the journal**. Any URL with a valid purpose
 * and a clean payload went to any host.
 *
 * Hosts were gated by a document instead: `tools/docs.test.ts` swept `https://`
 * literals out of `apps/extension/src` and required each to be listed. Three ways
 * past that, and none of them exotic: a literal in `packages/` (where the model
 * manager's and the leak lookup's own URLs live), a URL assembled from parts, and
 * anything not spelled `https://`. A gate that reads one directory for one prefix
 * is a gate about that directory and that prefix.
 *
 * **This list is the single source and the check is a comparison, not a scan.**
 * It is keyed by purpose rather than being one flat set, because "the leak lookup
 * may reach Have I Been Pwned" and "the feed may reach Have I Been Pwned" are
 * different claims, and only the first is true.
