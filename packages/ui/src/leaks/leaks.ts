/**
 * SCR-08 — what is known to have leaked, and what was not checked.
 *
 * The coverage line is not a footnote here; it sits with the total, because a
 * number whose basis is unstated is the thing this screen exists to replace. A
 * list assembled from two of three sources says so in the same breath as its
 * count, and "nothing found" from a source that never answered is never shown
 * as reassurance.
 *
 * The attribution is not decoration either. Have I Been Pwned's breach data is
 * CC BY 4.0, which requires credit wherever the data appears — so it appears
 * here, on the screen that shows it, rather than only in a README a user will
 * never open. It is rendered in every state, including the empty one: a result
 * of "nothing found" is still a result computed from someone else's work.
 */

/**
 * Required by CC BY 4.0 wherever the data is shown.
 *
 * A function, not a constant. It was a constant, and moving its words into the
 * catalogue turned it into a `t()` call evaluated at **import** time — before
 * any entry point installs a resolver — so the credit line rendered
 * `[leaksAttribution]` while every other string on the screen was fine. Only
 * the test that asserted the actual words noticed.
