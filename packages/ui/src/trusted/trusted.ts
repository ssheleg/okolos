/**
 * The trusted-domain list, and the reason it has to exist.
 *
 * Trust is granted from the page: a comparison of two addresses offers "This is
 * legitimate", an interstitial offers "Continue anyway", and both are one click
 * in a moment of mild annoyance. The comparison view even promises, in those
 * words, that the decision "can be undone in settings".
 *
 * Until this surface existed that sentence was false. A domain trusted by
 * mistake — or trusted a year ago, before it changed hands — could not be taken
 * back through the interface at all. A security product that can only ever
 * lower its own guard is one whose guard eventually reaches zero.
 *
 * Each row says when the trust was granted and why, because "why" here is the
 * user's own past action and it is often the thing they have forgotten.
