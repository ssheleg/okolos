/**
 * The brand linter, with its exit codes mapped to a gate's two answers.
 *
 * `docs/brand/lint.py` answers in three codes — 0 clean, **1 warnings only**, 2
 * any error — and a gate wired straight to it would refuse a push for a warning.
 * That matters here: the ux linter has carried two known warnings for weeks
 * (SCR-17 and SCR-18 orphans, B-22), and a project whose gates refuse over
 * warnings is a project that learns `OKOLOS_SKIP_GATES=1`, which is how the one
 * load-bearing gate stopped being load-bearing in August.
 *
 * So: errors refuse, warnings are printed and pass. The mapping lives here, in a
 * file with a reason, rather than as `|| [ $? -eq 1 ]` in a package.json string —
 * a shell trick nobody reads is a shell trick nobody notices inverting.
