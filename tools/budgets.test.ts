 * before the product would have called the call failed — and Playwright's per-test
 * timeout was 30 s, the same number as the product's deadline, so it killed the test
 * at the instant either side might have said something. The observable result was
 * "44 × locator resolved to 0 elements" and two nights of guessing (B-73, and the
 * SURFACE_MOUNT_MS incident before it).
 *
 * Asserted rather than commented, because three numbers in three files drift into an
 * inversion the moment one is tuned alone — and the inversion is invisible: every
 * test still passes, right up to the one run where the worker is slow.

/**
 * A wait in a browser spec carries a name, or it carries its reason.

 * `e2e/budgets.ts` exists because ten seconds was written into thirteen spec files and
 * measured nowhere; it produced failures on CI that had nothing to do with what the tests
 * were about. The conversion happened — and **the siblings were missed**: fourteen literal
 * waits were still there on 2026-08-20, one of them at ten seconds in `budget.spec.ts`,
 * which is the check that reddened CI that evening, and one of them in the very helper
 * written that afternoon to fix a different flake.
 *
 * That is the class appearing a third time, so it becomes a check rather than a third
 * edit. What it protects is a reader's ability to tell a busy machine from a broken
 * fixture: a named budget says which of the two ran out, and a literal says nothing.
 *
 * **Short waits stay allowed, and must say why.** A wait that asserts a *failure* — a
 * control that cannot be clicked — has to be short, or the suite pays for a truth it
 * already knows. Those are listed here by file and reason rather than pattern-matched,
 * because "this number is deliberate" is a claim somebody has to make out loud.
