/**
 * Is the built extension the tree that is here, or one from before the edit?
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Two e2e harnesses load two different build directories —
 * `e2e/hooks.ts` takes `dist/chrome-e2e` (shadow roots open so a test can click
 * what a user clicks), `e2e/fixtures.ts` takes `dist/chrome` (production) — and
 * the specs are split roughly half and half. `pnpm build:e2e` refreshes only the
 * first. `pnpm test:e2e` runs both builds, so CI is right; the person running
 * `npx playwright test` after one build is the one who gets a green from an
 * artefact that is arbitrarily old.
 *
 * Measured, not imagined: in the B-42 iteration a planted defect ("the button
 * deletes on the first click") stayed green across three `scn-023` checks, because
 * those read `dist/chrome` and only `chrome-e2e` had been rebuilt. After both
 * builds the same plant reddened all three. That was the second stale-artefact
 * false conclusion in one session — the first being `tsc`'s emit in B-36 — and both
 * times the only thing that caught it was a habit.
 *
 * **A habit is not a mechanism.** So the harness asks, before it launches a
 * browser: is there a build here at all, and is anything the build reads newer
 * than it. The two failures have to stay distinguishable — "never built" and
 * "built the wrong one" are different mistakes with different fixes — so they are
 * reported as different sentences.
