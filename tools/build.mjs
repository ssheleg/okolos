/**
 * Builds a loadable extension for each browser.
 *
 * Three separate passes, because the targets genuinely differ:
 *   - the content script must be one self-contained IIFE (Chrome does not
 *     support modules in content scripts, and a split chunk would simply fail
 *     to load on the page it is meant to protect);
 *   - the background is a module in both browsers;
 *   - the pages are ordinary multi-page HTML.
 *
 * The manifests are hand-written per browser rather than generated. They are
 * the security surface of the whole product — the permission list is the
 * promise a reviewer and a user actually read — and a generated manifest is
 * one indirection away from nobody noticing a permission appear.
