/**
 * How a finding crosses from the context that found it to the one that shows it.
 *
 * Two rules, both parts of ADR-0013, both written in comments and held by nothing until
 * 2026-08-20. They are in one file because they answer one question — what a report may
 * rely on when it leaves its own context — and separating them would let a reader fix one
 * while breaking the other.
 *
 * ## The background may set a timer to **give up**, never to **wait**.
 *
 * An MV3 service worker is torn down when the browser decides, and a pending `setTimeout`
 * does not stop it. So anything that sleeps in the background is a plan the browser is
 * free to cancel halfway — and the failure it produces is the worst kind: it works most
 * of the time. Measured on 2026-08-20, B-82: a delivery loop of twelve attempts over nine
 * seconds lived here, and the same end-to-end spec passed and failed across identical
 * runs until the loop was replaced by a question the receiving document asks.
 *
 * A deadline is the opposite shape and stays allowed. `setTimeout(() => reject(...))`
 * makes work *end* sooner; the worker dying early only brings forward what the timer was
 * going to do. `setTimeout(resolve, ms)` makes work *continue* later, and the worker dying
 * cancels it. So the rule is about which way the timer points, not about timers.
 *
 * Recorded as [ADR-0013](../docs/adr/0013-a-finding-crosses-contexts-by-being-asked-for.md).
