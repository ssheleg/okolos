/**
 * The wipe confirmation must name every kind of data the wipe clears.
 *
 * REQ-32 asks for a confirmation that names what is about to go, because "are you
 * sure?" tells the reader nothing they did not already know. It named five kinds
 * while `wipeAll` cleared nine stores: `models`, `feeds`, `snapshots` and `reuse`
 * went unmentioned, the last of them the index derived from the user's password
 * that `docs/privacy.md` gives its own section to. The user agreed to five and nine
 * went — safe in direction, and still a confirmation that did not ask.
 *
 * It lived through review because the list was written twice. The renderer held
 * five keys and the renderer's own test held the same five, so the two agreed with
 * each other and neither agreed with the schema. Two copies of a wrong list read as
 * confirmation, which is why this file compares against `STORES` and against the
 * shipped catalogues instead — three artefacts that cannot all be edited by
 * accident.
 *
 * This lives in `tools/` and not beside either side, because it is the only place
 * entitled to see both: `packages/ui` does not depend on `@okolos/storage`, and
 * giving it that dependency to satisfy a test would open the production import too.
