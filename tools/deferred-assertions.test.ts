/**
 * A test that puts off an assertion says what it is waiting for.
 *
 * Standing instruction 6 in `docs/superpowers/retro.md` has said this since the first run,
 * and it existed because of a real loss: the HIBP attribution waited three releases inside a
 * comment. A promise that lives only in prose is tracked by nothing — no ledger row, no
 * board id, no failing test. The comment reads as diligence and behaves as a decision to
 * forget.
 *
 * The sweep finds nothing today: every deferral this repository had was paid (B-75 and the
 * instalments after it). That is why this file is a **regression guard** rather than a
 * discovery, and why the rule is demonstrated on synthetic lines below rather than left to
 * be proven by the next accident — a sweep that passes on an empty tree proves nothing about
 * the rule it claims to enforce.
