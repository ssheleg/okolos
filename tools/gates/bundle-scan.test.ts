 * Stripping literals is the third option, and it narrows nothing: every real
 * call still shows up, as the planted-defect check below asserts.
 *
 * **Only on source, never on a minified bundle.** The regex-literal pass has to
 * guess where a regex starts, and minified output is full of division and of
 * slashes inside surviving strings — so a false opening runs to the next slash
 * and deletes everything between. Measured 2026-08-20: a gate that read a bundle
 * through this helper stayed green with `crypto.randomUUID()` plainly present in
 * the file, because the span containing it had been eaten. The bundle checks in
 * this file read the raw text for exactly that reason, and a token found in a
