/**
 * Checks the graph that was saved, not the layer that produced it.
 *
 * graphify's own diagnostic reads the raw extraction, and on a two-layer build
 * that is the wrong scope: the semantic pass legitimately points at nodes the
 * AST pass supplies, so it reports edges as dangling that are nothing of the
 * kind. A run of it was read here as "225 edges point nowhere" and repeated to
 * the user before anyone measured the artefact. The saved graph had none.
 *
 * So this reads `graph.json` and answers three questions it can answer about the
 * saved artefact: does every edge land on a node that exists, was the graph built
 * from the tree that is here now, and has a code file appeared that the graph
 * connects to nothing.
 *
 * **Staleness is the one that matters most, and it used to be unasked.** A wrong
 * document gets argued with; a wrong graph gets believed, because it arrives with
 * the authority of a machine. This one was built on `ab70f5b` and read as current
 * for twelve days.
 *
 * **Orphans are reported, not gated — except the code ones.** Of the 37 in the
 * August graph, 14 were documents, 12 rationales and 7 concepts: semantic nodes the
 * extraction did not link, and demanding zero would be demanding that a heading be
 * imported by something. The four code orphans were `playwright.config.ts`,
 * `vitest.config.ts`, `tools/imports.d.mts` and a first-run `index.html` — every
 * one loaded by a runner rather than imported by a module, which is why they have no
 * edges and never will. A *new* code orphan is the interesting case: a file nothing
 * imports and which imports nothing is either dead or a hole in the extraction, and
 * both are worth a look. So that list is named below and growing it refuses.
 *
 * Not a `pnpm gates` step — `graphify-out/` is gitignored, so on a fresh clone and
 * in CI it is absent, and a gate that answers "ok" to an absent artefact is the
 * shape where absence reads as a pass. It refuses on absence instead, and runs where
 * the graph is: after `/graphify`. `docs/runbooks/development.md` records that, and
 * `tools/graph-check.test.ts` holds the record, so nobody closes the mismatch by
 * adding a step that quietly skips.
