/**
 * What counts as a user-facing sentence written in code, and what does not.
 *
 * Its own module because the sweep that uses it is a script with side effects — it
 * scans, it prints, it exits — so nothing in it could ever be called from a test. The
 * one load-bearing gate of this project had its pattern checked only by running it over
 * the tree and reading the output, which is how two whole classes of sentence stayed
 * invisible for weeks (B-76) and how a widening fix introduced a match that walked out
 * of one string literal and into the next.
 *
 * Every rule here is pinned by `tools/i18n-pattern.test.ts`, one case per class, with
 * the string that defeated the previous version quoted in the test.

/**
 * One word — Latin or Cyrillic — optionally with an interpolation glued to it.
 *
 * Cyrillic joined on 2026-08-20. The anchor read `[A-Za-z]` and `\w`, which is
 * `[A-Za-z0-9_]` in JavaScript, so a Russian sentence hard-coded in a package was
 * invisible to this gate — and a Russian sentence in code ships **untranslated to the
 * English catalogue's readers**, which is the same defect as an English one mirrored.
 * Widening it found nothing in the tree, which is the answer worth having: the class was
 * uncovered rather than dirty.
 *
 * A short name is still not matched — `'Список Okolos: фишинг'` has no run of lowercase
 * words — and that is right. A name is not copy in the sense this gate is about, and
 * `tools/feed-names.test.ts` holds names to `docs/brand/terminology.md`.
 *
 * The apostrophe may only appear *inside* a word — `don't`, never `installed'`. Allowing
 * it at the end let a match walk out of one string literal and into the next: the union
 * in `core-extensions/src/diff.ts` reads `'newly-installed'; readonly severity: 'minor'`,
 * and a trailing apostrophe plus a semicolon turned that into a three-word "sentence"
 * spanning two quotes. Found by running the widened pattern over the tree, which is the
 * only way this class of defect ever shows up.

 * English sentence on the agent gate, the one surface a person meets mid-decision, in a
 * product that ships Russian first. Found by rendering the gate and reading it — this file's

 * is now a lookahead against the delimiter itself, so group numbering is unchanged.

 * the first word ends in punctuation, so the run of lowercase words never started. Four
 * of the six sentences in `core-gate` were hidden by exactly this, and the ceiling
 * counted two (B-76). A semicolon is *not* in the set — that is the character that let
