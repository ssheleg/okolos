/**
 * The pattern behind the project's one load-bearing gate.
 *
 * It had no test until 2026-08-20, and was checked by running it over the tree and
 * reading the output. That is how two classes of user-facing sentence stayed invisible
 * for weeks (B-76) — the ceiling counted two of the six in `core-gate` — and how the fix
 * for the first class introduced a match that walked out of one string literal into the
 * next. Every case below quotes the string that defeated a previous version.
