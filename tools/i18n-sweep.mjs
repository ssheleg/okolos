 * **It refuses, and that is the point.** For its first weeks it printed a number
 * and exited 0 from every state, including three sentences outside the catalogue —
 * so it was a report, and a report nothing reads is a report nobody reads. A gate
 * that cannot refuse is a comment with a run time.
 *
 * **`i18n-exempt: <reason>`, at the site, with the reason.** Some of these strings
 * are not copy: a control-flow signal caught two frames up and rendered nowhere, a
 * programming mistake thrown at whoever holds the debugger. Marking them here — on
 * the line or in the three lines above it — keeps the decision beside the string
 * instead of in a central list that outlives every reason in it. A bare marker is
 * refused (an exemption with no reason is an allowlist wearing a comment's
 * clothes), and so is a marker that annotates nothing: when the string it covered
 * was catalogued or moved, the marker left behind is how the next one gets waved
 * through.
 *
 * **What it cannot see.** Untranslated copy also travels as *data*: a value
 * passed into a substitution (`since: 'the last seven days'`), and a field
 * stored on a record and rendered later (`payloadShape: 'none'`). Both looked
 * like arguments to this sweep and like English to the reader, and both were
 * found by looking at a screenshot rather than by counting. A number from here
 * is a floor, not a total.
 *
 * It exists because the number kept being wrong. Four iterations reported 49,
 * 43, 36 and 15 remaining, each derived by a fresh throwaway regex, and every
 * one of them undercounted: the pattern required a capital first letter, and
 * the self-audit log's purpose lines — "downloading the list of known-bad
 * sites", "triggered by alarm:feeds" — start lowercase. The true figure when
 * this file was written is 44. A measurement re-invented per run is a guess
 * wearing a number's clothes.
