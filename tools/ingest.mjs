 *
 * The feed shipped to production until now held four `.test` domains. The
 * mechanism worked and protected nobody, which is a worse position than an
 * obviously missing feature: every gate was green about a list that blocked
 * nothing real.
 *
 * ## Why one source and not three
 *
 * The extension blocks by **host** — `declarativeNetRequest` rules built from
 * `||host^`. That decides which feeds can be used at all.
 *
 * **URLhaus is not ingested, and the reason is the interesting part.** It lists
 * *URLs* where malware is hosted, 63,978 of them, and the third line of the
 * download is a `dropbox.com` link. At host granularity that entry blocks
 * Dropbox for every user of this extension. The same is true of the Google
 * Drive, GitHub and Firebase Storage URLs further down. A malware URL on a
 * shared host is a fact about the URL, not about the host, and this product
 * cannot act on it without a path-level mechanism it does not have.
 *
 * **Phishing Army extended is not ingested either**, for a quieter reason: it
 * is a cumulative aggregate of 600k+ domains with no dates, and the rule
 * ceiling is 5000. Taking 5000 of 600k with no recency signal is not a
 * selection, it is a coin toss with a number attached.
 *
 * **OpenPhish community is ingested**: ~300 live phishing URLs, refreshed
 * roughly twelve-hourly, each a host set up for the campaign. It is the shape
 * a host-level blocklist under a hard ceiling actually wants — fresh, small,
 * and about hosts rather than paths.
 *
 * ## What this refuses to do
 *
 * A source that fails must never produce a **smaller** list. Publishing fewer
 * entries because a fetch timed out silently unblocks whatever fell out, and
 * the feed's own version number would announce the shrinkage as an update. So a
 * failed fetch stops the run.
