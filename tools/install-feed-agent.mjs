 * Installs the feed-refresh agent on this machine, or prints what it would do.

 *   node tools/install-feed-agent.mjs            # write the plist and load it
 *   node tools/install-feed-agent.mjs --dry-run  # print the plist, touch nothing
 *   node tools/install-feed-agent.mjs --uninstall
 *
 * The schedule cannot live in CI: ADR-0002 keeps the signing key off every
 * server, so the feed is signed and published from the machine that holds it.
 * That makes installing the agent a human step, and this reduces it to one
 * command — which is the difference between a step someone does and a step
 * someone means to do. Measured 2026-08-19, the meaning-to version left the
 * shipped list six days old, blocking one live host out of 248.
