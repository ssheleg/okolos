 * got a Russian line with an English exception in the middle — "Проверка страницы не
 * завершилась: Error: the background service refused …". Both texts are worth keeping: the
 * sentence is the reader's, the exception is the bug report's. They travel side by side now
 * (`diagnostic`), and the journal shows the second under the first (B-115).
 *
 * The rule is checkable because the shape is specific: a call that resolves a message —
