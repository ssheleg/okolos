/**
 * This product answers on its own screens, never in one of the browser's dialogs.
 *
 * Two writes reported failure with a modal — the generic `act` wrapper every action on the
 * options page goes through, and the extensions area's disable. Four things are wrong with
 * that, and the last is the one that matters: it blocks the page until dismissed; its text
 * cannot be styled, so a sentence written through the brand pack arrives in a system box;
 * the accessibility sweep never sees it; and it reads as *the browser* failing rather than
 * as this product answering. Every other failure here is a slot on the screen, replaced
 * rather than appended — SCN-023 and SCN-024 both say so.
 *
 * A confirmation is the same rule from the other side: the wipe screen asks its question on
 * the page, listing one data kind per store, which no dialog could do.
