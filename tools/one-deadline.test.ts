/**
 * One implementation of "reject if this never settles".
 *
 * It existed twice — `packages/platform/src/adapter.ts` for a message to a service worker
 * that may never answer, and `apps/extension/src/background/leaks.ts` for a source that may
 * never reply — and the copies had already drifted in how they tested the timer handle.
 *
 * This is the third pair of copies swept in one session: the instant formatters
 * (`tools/instants.test.ts`), the severity table (`tools/severity-words.test.ts`), and this.
 * The pattern is the same every time — the second caller needs the same fifteen lines, and
 * writing them is faster than finding them — and the cost is not the duplication but what
 * happens next: one copy gets a fix and the other does not. Here the copies decide
 * **behaviour under failure**, which is the worst place in a security product for two
 * answers to live.
