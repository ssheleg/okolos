/**
 * The archive you upload, built by one command that refuses to lie.
 *
 *   node tools/package.mjs           # builds, checks, writes dist/release/*.zip
 *   node tools/package.mjs --check   # every check, no archive
 *
 * Why a command and not a runbook: this session has twice paid for a step that
 * lived in a document. The feeds table stayed empty because publishing was a
 * sentence someone had to remember, and the feed's own source spent a release
 * in a temporary file for the same reason. A release is the worst place to
 * discover that habit.
 *
 * What it refuses to package, in order of how badly it would end:
 *
 *   - a build carrying the test hooks. Those open the shadow roots, which is
 *     exactly the property the in-page surfaces rest on: an open root lets a
 *     hostile page read and remove the warning about itself. Shipping that is
 *     shipping the vulnerability the product exists to prevent.
 *   - a manifest naming a file the package does not contain — an icon, a
 *     locale, a page. The browser rejects it, but only after the upload.
 *   - a stale build. The archive is made from a build this command performed,
 *     not from whatever was in `dist` from an afternoon of experiments.
