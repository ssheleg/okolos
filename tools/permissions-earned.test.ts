/**
 * Every permission is earned, and every API asked for is permitted.
 *
 * `tools/manifest.test.ts` already asserts the permission **list**, which catches an
 * addition nobody noticed. What it cannot catch is the other direction: a feature removed
 * while its permission stays. The list still matches the expectation, the store listing
 * still explains a capability the product no longer uses, and the user still reads it —
 * "a permission that reaches store review without being used is a cost with no benefit"
 * is that gate's own comment (B-50), and nothing was checking it.
 *
 * The reverse is worth more. An API the code calls without the matching permission fails
 * at runtime, silently, in whatever code path touches it — and on a path nobody exercises
 * in a browser test that is invisible until somebody's machine.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-20: all seven permissions are used. This exists so that stays true.
