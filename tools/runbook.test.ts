/**
 * A runbook whose commands do not run is a story about a repository.
 *
 * This project generates what would otherwise drift — icons, tokens, the
 * privacy page — for exactly one reason: a copy nobody regenerates diverges
 * from its source silently. A runbook is the same shape of artefact. It
 * restates `package.json` in prose, and prose does not fail when a script is
 * renamed.
 *
 * So it is checked in both directions. Every command it prints must resolve to
 * something that exists; and every script that exists must be named in it,
 * because a capability nobody knows about differs from a missing one only in
 * that it has already been paid for.
