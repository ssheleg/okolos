/**
 * A script name pnpm owns is a command nobody can run.
 *
 * `pnpm access` never reached `tools/access.mjs`: pnpm answers it with
 * `ERR_PNPM_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` before any script is consulted. The tool worked, the
 * runbook documented the form, and `tools/runbook.test.ts` **required** the runbook
 * to document it — so the project's own gate insisted on documenting a command that
 * cannot run. Nothing was red anywhere.
 *
 * The rule that closes the class rather than the instance: **a colon.** pnpm has no
 * command with one in it, so a namespaced script can never be shadowed. Names that
 * are single words are allowed only where forwarding has been measured, and the
 * measurement is dated below.

/**
 * Single-word names measured to reach the script, 2026-08-20, pnpm 11.10.0.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: a throwaway package.json whose every script echoed a
 * sentinel, one `pnpm <name>` per row, and the sentinel either appeared or pnpm's
 * own command answered instead. The same probe found `access`, `publish`, `pack`,
 * `audit`, `licenses`, `outdated`, `why`, `link`, `patch`, `fetch`, `prune`,
 * `import`, `store`, `root`, `bin`, `exec`, `dlx`, `create`, `init`, `config`,
 * `env`, `stage` and `dedupe` intercepted — so this list is the safe side of a
 * boundary that has both.
 *
 * Anything new goes through a colon instead of being added here. Growing this list
 * means re-running the probe against the pnpm of the day; a colon needs no probe.
