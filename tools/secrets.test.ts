/**
 * A secret the product stores must be one the export refuses to hand out.
 *
 * The defect: `settings` held `reuse:key` — the HMAC key the password-reuse index
 * is tagged with — and `exportAll` dumped every store verbatim. One file carried
 * both the tags and the key that reverses them, so whoever received it could run
 * a dictionary of common passwords against the tags and recover which password is
 * used on which sites. It also carried `hibp:apiKey`, the user's own paid
 * credential, in plain text. The button that produced that file is the one the
 * privacy page offers as proof of good faith.
 *
 * `packages/storage/src/export.test.ts` proves the two known secrets do not
 * appear in the file. This gate is about the *next* one: it reads the settings
 * keys the extension actually writes, decides by the shape of the name which of
 * them look like credentials, and requires each to be declared withheld. A list
 * maintained by hand stops being maintained; a rule about shape keeps applying to
 * keys nobody has written yet.
