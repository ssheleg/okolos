/**
 * One table maps a severity to its word.
 *
 * There were two, under two names — `SEVERITY_KEY` in the banner and `SEVERITY_WORD_KEY` on
 * the dashboard — and the queue was one edit from being a third. The dashboard's own comment
 * records why the table exists at all: a first draft of that band invented
 * `high`/`medium`/`low` and three keys to go with them, "a second vocabulary for severity,
 * introduced by the very pass whose job was to stop one action having two names". Two copies
 * of the *right* table are the same failure one step later — they agree until one is edited,
 * and the screens then disagree about how serious the same finding is.
 *
 * The queue also showed the other half of this class: a surface that carries severity and
 * words it **nowhere**. That is not a duplicate table and no grep for one would find it —
 * it is checked where it can be seen, in `packages/ui/src/queue/queue.test.ts` and on the
 * rendered page.
