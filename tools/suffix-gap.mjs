/**
 * How far the shipped suffix table is from the real Public Suffix List, in numbers.
 *
 * **Why a tool and not a gate.** The list lives at `publicsuffix.org`, and a gate that
 * fetches it goes red on the day that host has a bad afternoon — the flake class this
 * project refuses, and the same reason `graph:check` is not in `pnpm gates`. So this is
 * run on purpose, like rebuilding the graph, and what it prints is what the decision in
 * `suffixes.json` rests on.
 *
 * **Why the decision is not "vendor it".** Measured 2026-08-20: the whole list is 171 KB
 * of JSON against a 61.5 KB content script, injected and parsed on every page; the
 * private section alone is 69 KB. Both leave 283 wildcard and 8 exception rules
 * unimplemented. What it buys, against the 248 hosts of the shipped feed: three sat
 * under a private suffix this table lacked, and **zero** were themselves an unknown
 * private apex — the case that emits a `||host^` rule over an entire platform. Those
 * three families were added by hand instead.
 *
 * **The two sections fail in opposite directions, which is why they are counted apart.**
 * A missing ICANN suffix reads a registrant's domain one label short and can only lose
 * a finding. A missing private suffix lets the blocklist treat a platform's apex as a
 * site and take the platform down for everyone who installed this.
 *
 *   node tools/suffix-gap.mjs                 # fetch and compare
 *   node tools/suffix-gap.mjs <file.dat>      # compare against a copy already on disk
