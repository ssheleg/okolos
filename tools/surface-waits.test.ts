/**
 * A spec waiting for one of this product's in-page surfaces goes through `e2e/surfaces.ts`.
 *
 * Between a navigation and a banner there are five links — the extension loaded, the worker
 * booted, the content script ran, it produced a verdict, the RPC came back — and
 * `expect(locator).toHaveCount(1)` distinguishes none of them: it reports
 * *"74 × locator resolved to 0 elements"*. `expectSurface` runs the same assertion with
 * the same budget and, on failure, prints which link broke.
 *
 * The helper existed and ten files used it. Eight hand-rolled the assertion beside it, and
 * the cost is measured: the class has failed on CI three times for a banner that never
 * arrived (B-65 twice, B-108 once), each time from a file that had no report — and the last
 * one cost a downloaded trace and an hour of hypotheses to reach a fact the helper prints
 * in one line. One of those files could not have called the helper at all: it matches the
 * host by attribute, because the host takes an unpredictable name when a page claims the
 * canonical one, and the helper took no selector until 2026-08-21.
 *
 * So: a helper the sibling case cannot call gets hand-rolled beside it, and a helper
 * nothing enforces gets hand-rolled anyway.
