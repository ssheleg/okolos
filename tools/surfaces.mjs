/**
 * The surfaces a store screenshot shows, and a digest of their content.
 *
 * Two callers, one definition: `tools/screenshots.mjs` records the digest when it takes
 * the images, and `tools/listing.test.ts` recomputes it to decide whether the images
 * still show the product.
 *
 * **Content, not history.** The first version of that gate compared commit dates — last
 * commit touching the screenshots against last touching these paths — and the rule can
 * demand the impossible: a surface change that alters no pixel leaves the four files
 * byte-identical, so git records nothing and no commit can ever satisfy it. The second
 * version had a subtler form of the same fault: a receipt naming a commit cannot name the
 * commit it is part of, so it is stale the moment it is committed.
 *
 * A digest of the content has neither problem. It changes whenever the surfaces change,
 * it is knowable before the commit exists, and it needs no repository history at all —
 * which also means it works on the shallow clone CI makes by default.
