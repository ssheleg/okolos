/**
 * The shapes a test takes when it stops testing.
 *
 * Two of them, both written in this repository and both found by sweeping for
 * the pattern rather than by anything failing.
 *
 * `if (state !== 'ready') return` inside a spec reads as caution and behaves as
 * a skip: the assertions below it never run, the run is green, and the report
 * says the scenario passed. The one in `scn-017` would have hidden exactly the
 * regression that screen exists to survive — losing the `management`
 * permission — and it was written by the same hand that has spent this session
 * hunting vacuous greens.
 *
 * The rule is narrow on purpose. A bare `return` inside a spec body abandons
 * the test; a `return <value>` is a helper computing something, which is fine.
 * A branch that genuinely cannot be asserted belongs in a unit test where the
 * condition can be constructed, not in an end-to-end run where it is left to
 * chance.
