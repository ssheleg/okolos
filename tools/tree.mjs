/**
 * One definition of "the directories in here", shared by every gate that walks
 * the tree.
 *
 * `readdirSync(dir)` returns the *entries* of a directory, and the entries are
 * not the directories: macOS writes `.DS_Store` into any folder its Finder has
 * displayed, without being asked and without telling anyone. Three gates read a
 * directory and used each entry as a path segment, so all three were one Finder
 * visit away from a verdict about the file manager wearing the authority of a
 * verdict about the repository:
 *
 *   - `docs.test.ts` counted 20 packages and 3 apps against a document that
 *     correctly said 19 and 2 — red on the developer's machine, green on CI,
 *     where no Finder had ever run. It is the gate `.githooks/pre-push` leans
 *     on, so the only load-bearing gate this project has was refusing every
 *     push while printing the override flag in its own refusal text.
 *   - `locales.test.ts` failed five of its ten checks the moment `_locales`
 *     held one, in the gate that guards the message catalogue.
 *   - `licensing.test.ts` failed to load at all — the throw happens while the
 *     module initialises, so none of its checks run.
 *
 * The second and third were latent rather than absent, which is the worse
 * shape: they were passing because of where a person had happened to click.
 *
 * Two more gates read entries and are safe, for reasons worth naming so nobody
 * "fixes" them: `adr.test.ts` keeps only names matching `^\d{4}-`, and
 * `licensing.test.ts`'s manifest sweep drops paths that do not exist — the
 * second by accident, since that filter was put there for packages without a
 * `package.json`.

 * `test-quality` — and forbidding `readdirSync` in `tools/**` without giving them this
 * would have sent them to write an `eslint-disable` instead, which is a boundary that
 * teaches people to step over it (B-58).

 * and `dist` and none of them skipped anything else, so that is the default and it is
