/**
 * Wireframes derived from the renderers, not written beside them.
 *
 * Every screen record in `screens.md` points at a wireframe. Hand-written, that
 * file becomes a fourth copy of the truth — after the code, the scenario and
 * the screen record — and the one nobody updates. So it is generated: the
 * element inventory comes out of the renderer that produces it, and a test
 * asserts the committed file still matches. A screen that gains a control fails
 * the build until its wireframe is regenerated, which makes drift impossible
 * rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * What a generated wireframe is good for is the same thing a hand-drawn one is:
 * seeing at a glance what is on a screen and in what order. What it cannot do
 * is describe intent — that lives in the screen record's Purpose line, which is
 * written by a person and quoted here.

 * allow-list of helper names is the same silent-by-default shape as an allow-list of styled

 *
 * Matching *any* call shaped `f(doc, 'literal')` is too wide in the other direction —
 * measured: it read `createOverlayHost(doc, 'banner')` as a role and put three roles that
 * do not exist into three wireframes. What actually identifies these helpers is their
 * signature: they take a parameter called `role`. So the file is read for functions that
 * declare one, and only their call sites count — with the argument taken from the position
 * the parameter sits in, which is how `note(role, …)` is covered without naming it.

 * an inventory a person reads at a glance into a transitive closure. Where a screen
 * composes a component that itself composes another, the second level shows up in *that*
 * component's own wireframe, which is where a reader looking for it would go.
